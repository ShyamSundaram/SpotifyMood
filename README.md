# SpotifyMood
A module of a small project that helps find songs from Spotify that match your mood.<br>
This is done by matching output from sentiment analysis to songs from the spotify database that are classified as happy, sad, energetic etc based on the tempo, pitch, lyrics and other features.

**Note:** Don't bother using the same API tokens. They have expired more than a year ago. Create and use yours for free from Spotify :wink:
